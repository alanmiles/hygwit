    "As well as the reason for leaving, you'll see 'Full leaving benefits' next to some of the entries.  If this doesn't
    appear, then there may be deductions from an employee's leaving package ( - for example if the company uses a pension 
    scheme or pays a leaving indemnity, then this leaving reason may result in the full amount not being paid.)"
