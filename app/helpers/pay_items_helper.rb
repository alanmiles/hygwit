    "PAYROLL ITEMS are all the different kinds of employee payments, deductions and accruals made by a business.  Direct payments 
     and deductions will be shown on the payslip.  Accruals and payments to third parties will not. Together, all the items
     tell a business exactly what its employees are costing, and how the money is being spent."

  def payitem_instruction_2
    "Each business will need its own set of payroll items, but the list that we set up here will get them started.  Local 
     administrators won't be able to edit or delete the entries we've made, but they can hide them, add additional
     items, and re-sequence them."

  def payitem_instruction_3
    "Note that the 'Gross?' column shows whether or not the item is included in 'Gross Salary', important
     for tax, insurance, bonus and leaving gratuity calculations."
