  def insurance_rates_country_instruction_1
    "National Insurance contributions from employees and employers are usually calculated as a percentage of gross salary (though
      sometimes they're a fixed amount).  The contribution is calculated by applying the rates shown in the INSURANCE RATES table, 
      taking account of (1) the employee's insurance code and (2) the salary band defined in the insurance thresholds table."
  end
  
  def insurance_rates_country_instruction_2
    "The HR2.0 approach allows you to pre-set Insurance Rates for the future, as well as keeping track of historic rates in case
    backdated adjustments are required later."
  end
  
  def rebate_explain
    "Occasionally, the insurance rules state that as well as a contribution, there should be a rebate for certain insurance
     codes.  For example, in the UK, there are rebates for those who opt out of the goverment scheme and contribute to a 
     private pension.  Check 'Rebate' if this is the case for this entry."
  end
  
  def contribution_explain
    "Normally, the insurance contribution calculation will be a percentage of the employee's gross salary.  But sometimes it
      can be a fixed value, taking no account of salary.  If this is the case, check the 'Value' button."
  end
  
  def edate_explain
    "When did (or will) this rate take effect? You can enter a date in the future.  If you do, HR2.0 will automatically 
    apply the calculation formula, but not until the date arrives."
  end
  
  def threshold_explain
    "The select options for Salary Thresholds and Ceilings include the current settings and - if they've been entered - any
    future settings.  If there's more than one option, make sure you choose the right one as you enter or update the 
    insurance rate.  A threshold value must always be entered."
  end
  
  def ceiling_explain
    "This rate will be used to calculate the National Insurance for any salary greater than the threshold value, up to and including the
      ceiling value - also taking account of the employee's insurance code of course.  When you reach the highest salary
      milestone for the threshold salary, you can leave the Ceiling box blank - the rate will simply be applied to any salary value
      higher than the threshold."
  
  end
  
  def cancellation_explain
    "If the government announces that this rate will no longer be used, enter the date from when it will no longer apply.  
     The rate will remain in the history, but will no longer appear in the list of current rates after the cancellation date.  
     Remove the cancellation date if you need to restore the rate to the current list."
