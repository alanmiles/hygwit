    "If there's a single flat rate for insurance, regardless of salary, then you'll only need one line in the Settings Table: 
     'Standard Rate' (code 'ST') with all the milestones set to 0 - in other words, as soon as an employee earns any salary at all,
     insurance deductions are applicable."

    "Usually though, insurance deductions are salary-indexed.  For example, in the UK the 'Primary Index' ('PT') is the salary
    an employee can earn before deductions are made from salary. For the tax year commencing April 6, 2012, this value was £634 for 
    monthly-paid employees (£146 for weekly paid, £7605 for annually paid).  These values need be entered in Settings ... and there'll
    be more lines (currently 5 in the UK) to determine the salary milestones at which different deduction rates might apply."
