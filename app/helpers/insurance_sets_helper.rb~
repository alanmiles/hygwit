    "(First make sure first that the codes and salary settings for the date are up-to-date.  Then enter the date and click 'Create'.
     If no rates have been set for this date, HR2.0 will loop through the insurance codes and salary bands and create a new 
     record for each combination.  You then simply add the actual rates on the form displayed."

    "Any rates you've already set for the date will remain unchanged - and no new record will be created for the code/salary
    band combination.  So you can also use the form to edit all the rates for the date you enter."

    #{session[:insurance_date].to_date.strftime('%d %b %y')}.  (The Code-Band code is the insurance code + the salary threshold
    setting for the band.)  You need to add the correct contribution rates - 'edit' each of the lines."

    codes and salary settings and make sure everything's up-to-date and correct there - particularly if you've entered cancellations."
