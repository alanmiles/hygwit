    "You'll see that we've already added a few typical activities.  Add, delete and modify to suit your circumstances.  When 
     you've finished adding, sort the list into sequence - with the first action at the top and the last at the bottom.

     and/or marital status, and the hiring location.  Take this into account as you build your list - and HR2.0 will prepare
     a relevant check-list for each individual leaver."

     the circumstances when the action is relevant, taking account of employee nationality, contract status, marital status, 
     and hiring point."
