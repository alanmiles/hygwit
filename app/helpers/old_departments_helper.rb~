    "If the delete ('del') link appears, then the department has no links to any jobs, so it can be removed completely.  If 'del'
     does not appear, then the department is still attached to a job - one no longer in use - and that's why it can't be deleted."

     you'll either need to reactivate the division too, or choose a new division."

     be current for this to work.)"
