    "Build a list of everything you need to do when someone is hired - from offering the job right up until the employee starts work.  
     HR2.0 will then prepare an updatable check-list, helping you to make sure that the entire arrival process is smooth."

    "You'll see that we've already added a few typical activities.  Add, delete and modify to suit your circumstances.  When 
     you've finished adding, sort the list into sequence - with the first action at the top and the last at the bottom. 
     Change the list order by dragging and dropping using the red arrows in the '(move)' column."

    "Some of the joining activities will only apply in certain circumstances - depending on the new-hire's nationality, contract
     and/or marital status, and the hiring location.  Take this into account as you build your list - and HR2.0 will prepare
     a relevant check-list for each new employee."

    "Each action can be up to 50 characters long - duplicate actions are not allowed within a business.  Don't forget to define
     the circumstances when the action is relevant, taking account of employee nationality, contract status, marital status, 
     and hiring point."
