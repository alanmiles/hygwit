    effective date arrives. Then it will apply the new milestone values automatically, and any old values will be stored in 
    the threshold history. (It's important for us to keep the older values - just in case adjustments need to be made to 
    an employee's deductions paid in a previous year.  So don't delete or edit the current milestones when changes 
    are announced - just add a new set with a new effective date."
