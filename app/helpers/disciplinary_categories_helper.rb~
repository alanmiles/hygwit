    "Here we enter just a handful of typical DISCIPLINARY CATEGORIES - in any country.  When a new business is set up, 
    all these entries will automatically be added in the company account.  This will show local administrators what we
    mean by disciplinary categories.  They'll be able to add, edit, and delete categories to make the listing appropriate for their
    own businesses."
