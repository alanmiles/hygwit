  def job_instruction_1
    "This is a list of your current JOBS. Each job will have its own set of responsibilities and targets when we build an HR2.0 
     Achievement Plan.  So if you expect the same work outcomes from two (or more) employees they should share a job title - otherwise
     they should have different jobs."
  end
  
  def job_instruction_2
    "You can have the same job title in different departments - e.g. a secretary in both the legal and the sales
     department.  But HR2.0 won't let you duplicate a job title in the same department."
  end
  
  def job_instruction_3   
     "If no employees have ever been employed in a job, it can be deleted.  Otherwise it cannot, 
      although if none of its employees are current, you can select the 'Edit' option and declare that it's also no longer current: 
      the job will then no longer be displayed in this list."
  end
  
  def job_no_employees
    "This job has no current employees, so perhaps it is no longer used.  If so, then uncheck the 'Current?' 
     box to remove it from the Jobs listing. Later, if you want to, you'll be able to re-activate the job."
  end
  
  def job_fields
    "The job title must be 50 characters or fewer." 
  end
  
  def job_not_current
    "This job is not in your current list.  To reinstate it, check the 'Current?' box, then 'Save changes'.  (Note 
     that the department you select must also be current for this to work.)"    
  end
  
  def job_positions
    "Enter here the number of people you expect to employ for this job.  Although the figure doesn't appear in your list of 
     jobs, it will appear when you're involved in manpower planning and recruitment.  HR2.0 will work out the number of
     people currently employed and show you whether or not you have vacancies for the job.  You'll be able to change the
     number of positions at any time."
  end
  
  def job_occupations
    "We know a business where their receptionist is called 'Director of First Impressions'. Great job title! But if you used this
     job-title in a recruitment ad, would you find the right people - would outsiders know what you were talking about?  That's why
     we ask you to choose an 'occupation' from our list of generic job-titles, which everyone will understand.  We'll use this
     when you use HR2.0 for recruitment.  If you feel we need to add another occupation to the list, mail us on support@hroomph.com 
     with your suggestion."
  end
  
  def job_ranks
    "Assigning each job to a 'rank' in your business will help when you come to analysis - if for example, you wanted to
     find how employment costs break down between management, office staff, and support, or perhaps whether your shop-floor staff
     have a higher incidence of absence than other groups, etc."
  end
  
  def job_current
    "While 'Current?' is checked, the job will appear on your current job-lists, and you'll be able to assign new employees to 
    the department/job.  Uncheck the box and the job will be hidden - so you will no longer be able to assign employees to it.  You'll
    only be allowed to uncheck the box if no current employees in the department have this job title.  Later, if you want to, you'll 
    be able to reinstate an old job title.  Note that hiding a job title will not affect your historic records: former employees will
    remain linked to the job title they had at the time."
