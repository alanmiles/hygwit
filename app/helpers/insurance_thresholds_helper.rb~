    "Enter the date when these new threshold settings take effect and click on 'Create'.  The old settings remain intact (in case
     they're needed for reference later), but HR2.0 creates a group of identical threshold settings - identical except that the 
     effective date is the one you've just entered.  They're then automatically displayed in a list so that you can quickly replace the 
     old salary thresholds with the new ones."

    set of rates.  When you do this, use the same effective date, and the new threshold settings will be included automatically."
