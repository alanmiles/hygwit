    "If businesses issue employee loans, they may like a reminder of why the loan was issued. The LOAN TYPES
     we set up here will be downloaded to each business as it's set up - administrators will then be able to modify
     the list to suit their own requirements."

  def loan_instruction_2
    "Each loan-type is likely to have its own set of rules - how long the employee must have worked before qualifying, how
     much can be borrow, whether interest is charged ('APR' = the annual percentage rate of interest), etc.  Leave the rules settings at
     their defaults - administrators will then edit the values for their business."
